# Non-Claims (Hard Boundary)

This work does not claim:

- a proof or disproof of the Riemann Hypothesis
- a modification of the explicit formula
- a new zeta function identity
- a physical realization of the zeta function
- empirical predictions about matter, cognition, or consciousness
- that spectral stability corresponds to any physical phenomenon
- that the constraint layer is a new mathematical theory
- that Scalar Waze is anything other than a tool for exploring interpretations of the explicit formula

## Scope of Validity

All speculative statements are confined to interpretive constraint analysis and are labeled as such.
The mathematics underlying GeoPhase (e.g., RFC6979 cryptographic mechanisms) is independent of the interpretive layer.

## Engineering Independence

Cryptographic mechanisms (deterministic ECDSA nonces, commitments, attestations) rely on well-established standards (RFC 6979, Bitcoin/Ethereum standards) and do not depend on any interpretive layer or speculative claims about the zeta function or zero spectra.
