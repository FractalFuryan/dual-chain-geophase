# Scalar Waze Boundary (Math vs Interpretation)

## Mathematical Substrate Notice (non-negotiable)

The Gaussian explicit formula, its zero spectrum, and its prime-side expansion are classical results in analytic number theory.
We do not modify, extend, or claim ownership over these results. All number-theoretic statements remain standard and unchanged.

## Definition (Scalar Waze)

Scalar Waze refers to the use of the classical Gaussian explicit formula as a bidirectional analytic map between
zero spectra and prime power contributions, parameterized by a smoothing scale.

## Explicit Exclusions

Scalar Waze is:
- NOT a physical theory
- NOT a model of consciousness
- NOT a new zeta framework
- NOT a proof strategy for RH

## Boundary Rule

Scalar Waze stops at: "This identity holds."
Any work beyond this point must be labeled as interpretation/constraint-layer content.

## Constraint-Layer Mapping (FHCM / coherence framing)

This layer does not change the math. It introduces optional constraints on how one may interpret the spectrum.

| Classical object | Mathematical role | Constraint-layer role |
|---|---|---|
| zeros γ | spectral points | stability candidates |
| primes p | generators | discrete drivers |
| Gaussian σ | test function | bandwidth parameter |
| critical line | symmetry locus | stability condition |

## Permitted Conditional Claim (maximal defensible form)

If one treats the explicit formula as a stability-constrained field relation, then spectral mass away from the critical line
corresponds to instability under Gaussian bandwidth refinement.

(Conditional. Test-function dependent. Not a theorem. Not physics.)
